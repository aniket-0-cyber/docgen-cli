# `docgen-cli` Technical Documentation

## 1. Purpose/Overview

`docgen-cli` is a command-line tool built using Python and the `setuptools` package. It automates the generation of software documentation, leveraging AI capabilities for enhanced efficiency.  This `setup.py` file configures the package for installation and distribution.


## 2. Key Functionality

* **Package Configuration:**  Defines metadata for the `docgen-cli` package, including name, version, author, description, and dependencies.
* **Dependency Management:** Specifies required libraries (`typer`, `rich`, `gitpython`, `google-generativeai`) for installation using `pip`.
* **Entry Point Definition:** Creates a console script (`docgen`) that launches the application's main function (`docgen.cli:app`).
* **README Integration:** Reads and includes the project's README.md file in the package metadata.
* **Classifier Specifications:**  Provides information about the package's intended audience, programming languages supported, license, and operating system compatibility.

## 3. Simple Usage Example

The usage example would involve installing the package and then running the `docgen` command.  The specifics of the command-line interface are not defined within `setup.py`.

```bash
pip install . # Install from the current directory
docgen --help # Show available command-line options 
```


## 4. Important Notes

* This file (`setup.py`) only describes the package's structure and dependencies for installation; it does not contain the core documentation generation logic. That logic resides in the `docgen` package itself.
* The `install_requires` section lists the minimum required versions of the dependencies.  Updating these versions requires modifying this file and reinstalling the package.
* The `classifiers` section helps users and package managers understand the compatibility and suitability of this package for their environments.  Accuracy here is crucial for proper indexing and discoverability.
* The `google-generativeai` dependency suggests the use of Google's AI services for documentation generation; ensure proper API keys and authentication are configured separately.
