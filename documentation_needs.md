## What Developers Actually Look For
### 1. Quick Answers (Most Important)
- "How do I..." questions
  ```python
  # Example: How do I use the authentication module?
  from auth import Auth
  
  auth = Auth(api_key="your_key")
  user = auth.login(username, password)
  ```
- Common error solutions
  ```
  Error: Connection refused
  Solution: Check if API_KEY is set in .env file
  ```
- Function usage examples
  ```python
  # Get user by ID
  user = User.get(123)  # Returns User object
  print(user.name)      # Access properties
  ```

### 2. Context and Relationships
- Which other functions/modules this interacts with
  ```python
  # UserService depends on:
  # - AuthService (for validation)
  # - Database (for storage)
  # - EmailService (for notifications)
  ```
- What breaks if I change this
  ```python
  # Warning: This function is used by:
  # - PaymentProcessor.validate()
  # - UserAuth.check_permissions()
  ```
- Where to find related code
  ```python
  # Related files:
  # - models/user.py (data structure)
  # - services/auth.py (authentication)
  # - tests/test_user.py (examples)
  ```

### 3. Real-World Usage
- Copy-pasteable examples
  ```python
  # Complete working example:
  from payment import PaymentProcessor
  
  processor = PaymentProcessor(api_key="key")
  try:
      result = processor.charge(
          amount=1000,
          currency="USD",
          card_token="tok_123"
      )
      print(f"Payment successful: {result.id}")
  except PaymentError as e:
      print(f"Payment failed: {e}")
  ```
- Common patterns and best practices
  ```python
  # ✅ Recommended way:
  with resource.open() as r:
      r.process()
  
  # ❌ Avoid:
  r = resource.open()
  r.process()  # Resource might not be closed
  ```
- Edge cases and gotchas
  ```python
  # Warning: This API has rate limits
  # - 100 requests/minute
  # - 1000 requests/hour
  # Use batch operations for bulk updates
  ```

### 4. Troubleshooting Information
- Common error patterns
  ```
  Error: AuthenticationFailed
  Common causes:
  1. Expired API key
  2. Wrong environment (prod vs test)
  3. IP not whitelisted
  ```
- Debug steps
  ```python
  # Debugging steps:
  1. Check logs: tail -f /var/log/app.log
  2. Verify config: cat config.yaml
  3. Test connection: curl api.example.com
  ```
- Performance considerations
  ```python
  # Performance notes:
  # - Cache results for repeated calls
  # - Use batch processing for >100 items
  # - Indexes available on: id, email
  ```

### 5. Quick Reference
- Parameters and return values
  ```python
  def process_payment(
      amount: float,     # Amount in USD
      user_id: str,      # User's unique ID
      method: str = "card"  # "card" or "bank"
  ) -> dict:
      """Returns: {
          "id": "pay_123",
          "status": "success"|"failed",
          "amount": float
      }"""
  ```
- Configuration options
  ```yaml
  # Available configuration:
  MAX_RETRIES: 3    # Max retry attempts
  TIMEOUT: 30       # Request timeout (sec)
  DEBUG: false      # Enable debug logging
  ```
- Status codes/error messages
  ```python
  # Error codes:
  E001: "Invalid API key"
  E002: "Rate limit exceeded"
  E003: "Resource not found"
  ```
